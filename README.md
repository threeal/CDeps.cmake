# CDeps.cmake

Download, build, and install missing dependencies in [CMake](https://cmake.org/) projects.

The [`CDeps.cmake`](./cmake/CDeps.cmake) module allows CMake projects to make their external dependencies available during the build process, preventing the user from manually building and installing dependencies, and ensuring that the project uses the correct version of the specified dependencies.

This module provides the following commands to manage dependencies in CMake projects:

- `cdeps_download_package`: Downloads the source files of a dependency using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- `cdeps_build_package`: Builds a dependency using CMake.
- `cdeps_install_package`: Installs the targets of a dependency using CMake.

These commands enable a dependency to be downloaded, built, and installed as necessary. When combined with a [find package module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Finding%20Packages.html), they can serve as a fallback if the dependency is not already available in the system.

## Key Features

* Download dependencies using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* Build and install dependencies using CMake.
* Simple syntax and easy integration.

## Usage Guide

### Module Integration

The recommended way to integrate this module into a CMake project is by downloading it using the [`file(DOWNLOAD)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/file.html#download) command:

```cmake
file(
  DOWNLOAD https://github.com/threeal/CDeps.cmake/releases/download/v0.1.0/CDeps.cmake
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CDeps.cmake
  EXPECTED_MD5 bed206ba7a9d6cded38977ca95395dd4)

include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CDeps.cmake)
```

Alternatively, for offline use, this module can be vendored directly into a project and included normally using the [`include`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/include.html) command.

### Download, Build, and Install Dependencies

The following commands provide the basic functionality for downloading, building, and installing dependencies in a CMake project:

```cmake
cdeps_download_package(<name> <url> <ref>)
cdeps_build_package(<name>)
cdeps_install_package(<name>)
```

For example, the following commands will download, build, and install the [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library, making it available in the project and accessible via the [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) command:

```cmake
cdeps_download_package(FMT github.com/fmtlib/fmt 11.0.2)
cdeps_build_package(FMT)
cdeps_install_package(FMT)

find_package(FMT 11.0.2 CONFIG PATHS ${FMT_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/cmake)
```

### Find Module Integration

If used within a find package module, this module can provide dependencies as a fallback if they are not already available on the system. This allows the project to support offline use (if the package is already installed), while also enabling it to fetch missing dependencies from the internet.

For example, the following commands allow the {fmt} library to be fetched only if it is not already available in the system:

```cmake
# FindFMT.cmake

include(CDeps)
cdeps_download_package(FMT github.com/fmtlib/fmt ${FMT_FIND_VERSION})
cdeps_build_package(FMT)
cdeps_install_package(FMT)

include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
find_dependency(FMT CONFIG PATHS ${FMT_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/cmake NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
```

In the `CMakeLists.txt` file, you can use the `find_package` command as usual. This will attempt to locate the package on the system first, and if it is not available, it will fetch and make it available for the project:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)

# Required to prioritize package config files in `find_package` searches.
set(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG ON)

find_package(FMT 11.0.2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt)
```
